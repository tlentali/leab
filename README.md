  <b>le AB</b> is a Python library for AB testing analysis.
</p>

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

Before launching your AB test, you can compute the needed **sample size** :

```python
>>> from leab import before

>>> ab_test = before.leSample(conversion_rate=20,
...                           min_detectable_effect=2)
>>> ab_test.get_size()

6347
```

After reaching the needed sample size, you can **compare means** obtained from A VS B :

```python
>>> from leab import after
>>> from leab import leDataset

>>> data = leDataset.SampleLeMean()

>>> ab_test = after.leMean(data.A, data.B)
>>> teab_testst.get_verdict()

'Sample A mean is greater'
```

## üõ† Installation

:snake: You need to install Python 3.6 or above.

Installation can be done by using `pip`.  
There are [wheels available](https://pypi.org/project/leab/#files) for Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

```bash
pip install leab
```

You can also install the latest development version as so:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/tlentali/leab

# Or, through SSH:
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/tlentali/leab.git
```

## ü•Ñ Philosophy

> "*Life is a sum of all our choices.*"  
> **Albert Camus**

Get ready to take a decision !

AB testing has never been more popular, especially on Internet based companies.  
Even if each test is unique, some questions seem to be asked again and again :

- when is my test going to be statistically significant ?
- is A more successful than B ?
- does A generate more than B ?

Strong statistical knowledge are required to handle it from start to end correctly.  
To answer those questions in a simple and robust way, we built `le AB`.  
Lets Python do AB testing analysis !  

## üî• Features

Here are some benefits of using `Le AB` :

- **Sample size** : How many subjects are needed for my AB test ?
- **Test duration** : How many days are needed for my AB test ?
- **Rate of success** : Does the rate of success differ across two groups ?
- **Average value** : Does the average value differ across two groups ?

[Next release](https://github.com/tlentali/leab/projects/1) features :

- **sequential sampling** : How many conversions are needed for a sequential AB test ?
- **html auto-report** : Generate a nice html AB test analysis report √† la [Pandas-Profiling](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling).

## üôè Thanks

This project takes its inspiration from [Evan Miller](https://www.evanmiller.org/) great work, especially the following :

- [Sample Size Calculator](https://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/sample-size.html)
- [Chi-Squared Test](https://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/chi-squared.html)
- [2 Sample T-Test](https://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/t-test.html)

Thank you so much Evan M. for your work, it saved our lives so many times !  

A big thanks to [Max Halford](https://maxhalford.github.io/) too, who inspired us in the structure of this project, particularly for docs and tests.  
Have a look at [Creme-ml](https://github.com/creme-ml/creme), it's just amazingly done !

To finish, thanks to all of you who use or are going to use this lib, hope it helps !

`LeAB` is a Python library for AB testing analysis made with 💙 from Bordeaux 🍷 and Montréal 🍁.

Get ready to take a decision !

`LeAB` is a Python package designed to streamline A/B test analysis, from raw data to insightful results. It provides a clean API to define experiments, compute metrics, and interpret statistical outcomes with confidence.  
AB testing has never been more popular, especially on Internet based companies.
Even if each test is unique, some questions seem to be asked again and again :

- when is my test going to be statistically significant ?
- is A more successful than B ?
- does A generate more than B ?

Strong statistical knowledge are required to handle it from start to end correctly.
To answer those questions in a simple and robust way, we built **le AB**.
Lets Python do AB testing analysis !

## 🛠 Installation

`LeAB` is intended to work with Python 3.12 or above.

Installation can be done by using `pip` :

```bash
pip install leab
```

There are [wheels](https://pypi.org/project/leab/#files) available for Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

## ✨ Why LEAB?

A/B testing is a powerful tool, but often requires stitching together multiple tools and manual steps. LEAB aims to:

- 📊 Simplify and standardize A/B test workflows
- 🔍 Ensure statistical rigor with built-in checks
- 🧪 Support simulations and power analysis


Let the data speak—with confidence.

| AB testing has never been more popular, especially on Internet based companies.  
| Even if each test is unique, some questions seem to be asked again and again :

- when is my test going to be statistically significant ?
- is A more successful than B ?
- does A generate more than B ?

| Strong statistical knowledge are required to handle it from start to end correctly.
| To answer those questions in a simple and robust way, we built **le AB**.
| Lets Python do AB testing analysis !
